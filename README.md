# pullout-of-a-fiber
Finite element implementation in FEniCS. This code was used for all simulations in our paper "Pullout of neo-Hookean fiber embedded in a generalized neo-Hookean matrix".

The code is based on FEniCS 2019.1.0 (https://fenicsproject.org/) using Python3 environment. It consists of several files:
* axisym_neoHooke_case1.py, axisym_neoHooke_case2.py, axisym_neoHooke_case3.py: scripts corresponding to three different cases
* meshes/mesh1.geo, meshes/mesh2.geo: geometry scripts for two meshes
